## Verification scope — focused runs, full post-merge QA

This is the canonical policy for **when** checks run. Project command catalogs describe **how** to run them; an alias name such as `precommit` or `check.dispatch` does not require its execution. Apply this policy to implementers, reviewers, orchestrators and hooks. Explicit operator requests and concrete task acceptance criteria can require additional checks.

| Work / role | Required verification |
|---|---|
| Docs, roadmap, comments, text-only changes | Validate the changed artifact (for example rmap validation or AGENTS generation); no code suite, coverage or analyzers. |
| Implementation | Format changed code, compile where relevant, and add/run focused tests for the changed behavior and regression. |
| Reviewer | Independently assess the diff and acceptance criteria; run focused checks for affected behavior and relevant integration boundaries. The reviewer remains the acceptance gate. |
| Post-merge audit + QA | On the landed revision, run the full project suite, coverage and applicable analyzers: Dialyzer, Reach, Sobelow, Credo, Doctor, clone detection and language-specific equivalents. Review the integrated surface against roadmap intent and domain invariants. |

- **Commit, push, PR creation, reviewer handoff, branch switch, rebase, merge and `deps.get` are not by themselves reasons to run full QA.** Do not run full-project gates on every small change or every implementer/reviewer run. No project exception, including aave_sim.
- **Choose checks by changed behavior and risk.** Signing, money, authorization, crypto and external-provider changes still require their relevant security, boundary and live integration tests before acceptance. Missing credentials or failed checks are reported honestly, never converted into a green result. Preserve tests and thresholds; change when they run.
- **Broaden only for a named reason:** explicit request/acceptance criterion, or concrete evidence that focused checks cannot resolve a cross-module regression. State that reason and run the smallest additional check that resolves it. “To be safe” or an alias name is not a reason.
- **Coverage belongs to full QA.** Keep project thresholds (at least 80% standard / 95% critical unless a documented project baseline applies). Do not demand a whole-module coverage uplift before an unrelated edit. Add meaningful tests for the behavior being changed.
- **Inspect aliases before using them.** If `check.dispatch`, `precommit`, `ci`, a registered hint or an inherited hook bundles full tests/coverage/analyzers, use the explicit scoped commands for the run and report the configuration mismatch. Do not claim the alias became lightweight merely because the instructions changed.
- **Reuse evidence for the same revision and scope.** Capture command output once; do not rerun solely for readable logs or to repeat a passed check. A reviewer supplies independent judgment and relevant verification, not an automatic full-suite repetition.
- **Full QA is a separate, nonblocking post-merge audit responsibility.** Record revision/range, commands, results and missing checks. Failures produce visible findings and repair work; they do not retroactively unmerge or become a blanket next-wave/deployment gate. If automatic QA is not configured or has not run, say so; never infer success from the existence of this policy.

Maintain this policy in `~/.claude/includes/verification-policy.md`. Import it from project `CLAUDE.md`; regenerate `AGENTS.md` with `claude-marketplace/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`. Keep scheduling rules here, project-specific commands and justified risk checks in the project. Do not duplicate the policy in project prose.


Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository — the **`zenhive`** Claude
Code plugin marketplace (`ZenHive/claude-marketplace`, default branch `main`).

<!-- @-import: ~/.claude/includes/critical-rules.md -->
## Answer in short text

Short, pointed text — explanation, proposal, pushback, summary alike. Unclear → the user asks; too long → the user doesn't read it.

## Be a real partner, not a yes-sayer

- Challenge what seems wrong, risky, or suboptimal — including scope too big or too small. Make the case once, with the reason and the better alternative.
- Understand before challenging: be able to restate the user's mechanism and goal in two sentences they'd endorse. Can't → ask, don't challenge.
- "Not how software is normally built" is not an objection.
- Made your case and the user still wants it → commit fully. Pushback ≠ blocking.

### Think As an AI, Not Only As a Developer

| Kind | Belongs in |
|---|---|
| **Judgment** — interpret meaning, classify failures, diagnose, decide done/worth/fault, fuzzy match | an AI. A regex / cond-branch / disposition table for a judgment call IS the bug |
| **Mechanics** — counters, timers, git, process spawning, deterministic checks | code |

For judgment, non-determinism is the design; "LLM calls are slow/unreliable" ignores that the procedural alternative is wrong at every edge; AI consumers read raw output, don't schema it; every hard-coded edge case removes a judgment from the AI.

Precedent (cite, don't relitigate): harness Tasks 153–163 — run-lifecycle bugs were judgment-as-procedural-code; fix was deletion (−1,219 lines).

## No engagement farming — the turn ends when the work does

Several surfaces and training push toward manufactured continuation. Unasked, never:

- **Closing offers** ("Want me to also…?", "Let me know if…"). Finished work ends with the result; a real blocker is a statement.
- **Artificial checkpointing or deferral.** Authorized work runs to the end of scope in one turn. "Later" only means blocked, out of scope, or genuinely too large.
- **Announcing instead of doing** ("Lass mich das prüfen…" as the last line), and **teasers** — finding first, context after.
- **Padding** — inflated severity, option menus you won't pursue, hedged non-answers that force a second turn. Name the dependency *and* the pick.
- **Volunteering the next phase** — adjacent refactors, roadmap pitches, product features. Discoveries go to `rmap new`.
- **Proactive artifacts / diagrams.** Publish when asked or when the artifact is the deliverable.

Opinions of the user's idea are judgments with a reason, not affect. A correction gets verified before it gets agreed with. Completions are stated flat; no emoji outside a diff.

**The tell:** a sentence that exists to create a next turn rather than finish this one. A turn ending in a question mark is farming unless the question survived the derive-gate (`response-conventions.md`).

## Surface the override — don't decide silently

Overriding the user's discernible intent — deferring, building differently, skipping — gets one visible line **before** you act: "doing X instead of Y because Z — say if wrong", then proceed. Only clarity earns a silent decision, not habit or wanting-to-please.

## Stack is chosen per idea — never by default

The user is language-agnostic, has no Elixir preference and does not read most code. "The user's repos are Elixir" is never a reason.

**Assume web, desktop and mobile will be wanted** unless the user explicitly rules them out. Never pick a stack that silently forecloses a platform.

Decide in this order:
1. **Platforms → UI stack.** Multi-platform → TypeScript (React + Expo + Tauri/Electron) or Flutter. Elixir/LiveView only for explicitly web-only. Per-platform native (SwiftUI, Compose, WinUI, GTK) only when OS integration is the product (widgets, background execution, share/system extensions, platform UX a cross-platform stack can't reach) **and** harness has the native verification loop for that platform. Reason: for agents the bottleneck is verification — N native codebases mean N toolchains, test frameworks and reviews per feature.
2. **Official SDKs.** Use maintained official libraries (ccxt, viem, alloy, go-ethereum, protocol SDKs) in their language. Never port them.
3. **Known over own.** Product code sits on libraries agents know from training. Every library the user would own needs explicit approval, with the reason nothing known solves it stated in the task.
4. **Backend by main workload:**
   - multi-platform app → TypeScript end to end (chain via viem, exchanges via ccxt)
   - many long-lived stateful connections → Elixir
   - standalone integration service / worker with official SDKs in Go → Go
   - bounded core: EVM simulation (revm), heavy compute, Tauri backend → Rust
   - research / quant / ML → Python, not as default for long-running services
   - one backend language per app; a second only for a bounded core
5. **Maintenance cost.** Every library, package and publish is a permanent obligation.

Existing Elixir apps keep their backend; new clients attach via API (e.g. Ash JSON API) in the UI stack of rule 1. No rewrite without an oracle.

State the stack and the deciding criterion. A Hex publish as "distribution bet" (`portfolio-strategy.md`) is not approval.

Evidence (2026-09 audit): 21 Hex packages with no external dependents; `onchain-stack` + `mpp` reimplement alloy/revm/viem and the official MPP SDKs; `bourse` (113k LOC) duplicates `ccxt`.

## Never start the Phoenix server

It is always already running on localhost:4000. Never `mix phx.server`; to verify behavior, ask the user to check the browser.

## Tests

A feature without tests is not complete, even when the spec omits them.

A test must fail on a wrong outcome: no catch-all `{:error, _} -> :ok` / `assert true`. Match the specific expected error, `flunk` on anything else. Don't know which error to expect → explore first, then assert.

Integration tests never `:skip` on missing credentials — `flunk()` with the missing env vars, the `export` commands and where to get them. "0 failures" from 0 tests is a lie.

## Against an external API, the live provider is the oracle

Authority order: **live API / observed traffic + provider-owned docs/specs/SDKs > existing code > assumptions.** Third-party clients and wrappers (incl. CCXT) prove compatibility, never semantics.

- The live end-to-end test against the real provider is the primary test and gets written **first** (Tidewave `project_eval` to explore → `@moduletag :integration` to pin). Mocks, fixtures and recordings come afterwards, never instead.
- Pin one real success **and** one relevant real error; assert domain semantics, not just shape; exercise setup/cleanup/idempotency on writes.
- Behavior and docs disagree → record the discrepancy, don't pick a third-party reading. Can't reach the API → say so and `flunk`.
- A green claim names the independent evaluator + durable evidence (harness run, CI URL, review artifact). Self-report is not verification.

Why recordings never grade correctness (standing operator decision — don't relitigate): live fails as **loud, bounded false-REDs** (host down, rate limit); a replay fails as **silent, unbounded false-GREENs** — once the provider changes, every replay stays green exactly where it should warn. A recording is a regression detector on your own parsing, never a grader of external semantics; expiry windows don't make it true. Change frequency of the provider is irrelevant to this. Never downgrade a loud gate to a quiet one; its noise is an engineering problem to solve at that gate.

## Fix hook-flagged issues on files you touch

Hook fires → fix → re-run → stage, in this commit. Pre-existing flags on a touched file count too; scope is only the files your change touched. Generated files → fix the generator. Don't re-run a check the hook just ran on the same files.

## Read to the answer

Reason to the fix by reading code; run once to confirm, not to discover. Treat a failure as a survey: enumerate plausible causes, fix in a batch, run once. A compaction summary or another session's "X is already wired" is a hypothesis — `grep` it.

## Test-run economy

- 1–2 failures out of hundreds in a file your diff didn't touch → re-run that test alone (`mix test.json <file>:<line>` or `--failed`). Passes alone → proceed.
- Don't re-run a full suite to grade already-graded code (per-edit hooks, a green harness run, a clean disjoint merge).
- Bound output: `--cover` dumps hundreds of KB — always `--output /tmp/cov.json` + `jq`. Triage with `--max-failures 1` / `--failed` / one `file:line`.

## No pseudo-rigorous hedging

You have no telemetry or demand signal; the developer asking IS the demand signal. Don't gate requested work on "unproven demand", "wait until a Nth case", or "cheap to add later". A legitimate "wait" names an external blocker with an unblock path. Same for scores: "table-stakes" / "buyers expect" is not a reason — name a concrete one or score honestly low.

## Git — commit / push / PR allowed by default

Commit, push, open PRs without asking when the task calls for it; announce in one line. Only gate: **rewriting already-pushed history** (force-push, amend/rebase of shared commits) — confirm first.

The working tree is shared — stage path-scoped:
- Never `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a`. Stage `git add <path>` or commit `git commit <path>`; check `git diff --cached --name-only` before every commit.
- Pre-commit hook trips on a foreign file → `git stash push -- <their paths>`, commit yours, `git stash pop`, re-stage. Never fix someone else's work to clear a hook.
- Untracked files you didn't create: leave them.

## Never broadcast an unpatched vulnerability in a committed file

A committed file is public and permanent in git history. Exploit-actionable detail (mechanism, trigger value, PoC, unpublished GHSA/CVE id) never goes into `roadmap/tasks.toml`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, code comments, or commit messages.

- **Open + undisclosed → out of git.** Track in a private draft GitHub Security Advisory (`gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/security-advisories -X POST`, draft; `vulnerabilities[]` needs ecosystem + package + `vulnerable_version_range`). One per issue.
- **Fixed AND advisory published** → fine to reference. Both, not either.
- **Scheduling the work** → rmap task with a sanitized body: `"harden Tempo fee-payer gas bounds — see private advisory <id>"`.
- During embargo, commit messages and CHANGELOG describe the shape of the fix, not the hole. Public ledgers carry only closed / tracked rows plus a generic open count.
- **Inbound reports** appear ONLY under Security → Advisories (`gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/security-advisories`) — not Dependabot or notifications. Query it; act on `triage` and `draft`.
- **On fix:** patch → release → publish the advisory naming the patched version, same day.
- Already committed = already leaked: redact, and treat history as compromised (rotate/patch).

## Shell safety

`rm` is permitted. Before an irreversible delete, glance at the target — no unexpanded `$VAR`, no over-broad wildcard, not a path you didn't create. `git rm` for tracked files.

## No destructive dependency commands

Never without explicit consent: `mix deps.clean` (incl. `--all`), `mix deps.unlock --all`, `rm -rf _build`, `rm -rf deps`, `mix clean`. Compile error → retry `mix compile` / `mix test`; specific dep → `mix deps.compile <dep> --force`.

## Never pin a dependency to git or path — release it

A `github:` / `git:` / `path:` dependency (or the `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` equivalent) is a rejection, above all for our own libraries. A library change needed by an app is a task in the library's repo, released with a version bump, then consumed as `{:lib, "~> x.y.z"}`.

- **Implementer:** report "blocked on a `<lib>` release: needs `<change>`". Don't open a library PR from inside the app run and pin its head; don't vendor the code.
- **Reviewer:** a new git/path dep on a package we maintain is a `reject`; on a third-party package a `reject` unless the task body names the pin and why no release exists.
- **Exceptions:** `in_umbrella: true`, and a pin the task body explicitly authorizes with the upstream release it waits for.
- **Precedent:** aave_sim task 148 pinned `bourse` to its own open PR head; the reviewer approved it, and the release still hadn't happened a week later.

## No scope-sequencing qualifiers in durable artifacts

Never write "X first", "starting with X", "initially", "for now", "MVP: X" into repo descriptions, READMEs, moduledocs, code/config comments, commit messages, or vision one-liners — they become unremovable. Sequencing lives in the roadmap only (milestones, task bodies, `out_of_scope`). Describe what the system IS. Exception: inside a `TODO:` comment, which exists to be tracked and removed.

## Integrity

Never fabricate information, experience, metrics or timelines. Distinguish codebase observation / general knowledge / speculation, and name the source ("based on `file.ex`…").

## Research before asserting on niche technical claims

Research proactively (WebFetch when the canonical URL is known, WebSearch otherwise) and cite what you fetched for:
- **Wire formats / encodings** — RLP, ABI, SSZ, Protobuf, BLS, BIP-32/39/44, EIP-712, CBOR, ASN.1/DER. Never byte order, length prefix, padding or canonical form from memory.
- **Protocol details** — EIPs, RFCs, JSON-RPC shapes/error codes, opcode gas, exchange API quirks.
- **Niche / recent library APIs** — about to write `# probably something like`? Fetch the docs.
- **Cross-implementation edge cases** — check ≥2 reference impls; agreement across two is the spec in practice.

Skip for mainstream language/framework knowledge and anything in the codebase or a loaded include. Fetch fails or is ambiguous → say so and lower confidence.

## No evasion — sit with the hard thing

Hitting a wall and silently moving to easier work is the failure. Deferring, skipping, "out of scope", "you could manually…" need the user's approval. Blocked → name it: "blocked on X because Y. Options: A, B." Tempted to add a fallback or nil-guard for missing data → ask whether it should come from upstream; then report instead of working around it. Must move on → a tracked TODO, not a silent gap.


## What this is

A single Claude Code **marketplace** (`zenhive`) distributing six **independent
plugins**. A marketplace is the distribution unit; a plugin is the isolation
unit. Per-repo configurability comes from enabling/disabling plugins in
`enabledPlugins`, not from drawing marketplace boundaries. See `README.md` for
the roster and the phxagents boundary, `SKILLS.md` for the skill catalog, and
`CHANGELOG.md` for history.

The marketplace ships only what a current model does not carry and what
phxagents does not cover: harness orchestration, ZenHive's roadmap/workflow
methodology, ZenHive's own Hex packages, and a handful of deterministic
mechanic hooks. Generic Elixir/Phoenix knowledge, style nudges and
"model-limitation" reminder hooks were removed in 0.2.0; do not reintroduce
them. A hook earns its place by running a tool (format, compile, a test, a
git check), not by reminding the model of a rule it already has in
`critical-rules.md`.

## Includes → Skills sync (the load-bearing invariant)

**`~/.claude/includes/*.md` are canonical.** Most skill `SKILL.md` bodies in this
repo are auto-synced *from* those includes — never edit a synced `SKILL.md` body
directly (the repo-local MH-1 hook denies it and redirects you to the include).
The single source of truth for the mapping is `scripts/skill-include-map.sh`,
which drives **both**:

- `scripts/sync-skills-from-includes.sh` — writes synced bodies (preserves
  frontmatter, replaces body with include content).
- `scripts/hooks/block-skill-edits.sh` — denies direct edits to mapped files.
  Wired in this repo's `.claude/settings.json` (PreToolUse), together with
  `scripts/hooks/validate-marketplace-json.sh` (PostToolUse, MH-2). Rule IDs in
  `HOOK-RULES.md`.

After editing any include:

```bash
./scripts/sync-skills-from-includes.sh            # sync all mapped skills
./scripts/sync-skills-from-includes.sh --dry-run  # preview
```

The `harness` plugin's skills (`harness-driver`, `harness-workflow`) are **not**
in the map — they self-sync from their own canonical sources with per-file
headers. Native (hand-authored) skills are copied directly, not synced.

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skill-include-map.sh` | Single source of truth for SKILL.md ↔ include mapping (sourced by the sync script and the block hook). |
| `sync-skills-from-includes.sh` | Sync mapped SKILL.md bodies from `~/.claude/includes/`. |
| `hooks/block-skill-edits.sh`, `hooks/validate-marketplace-json.sh` | Repo-local hooks (MH-1, MH-2). |
| `sync-agents-md.sh` | **Manual** AGENTS.md generator — inlines a repo's CLAUDE.md @-imports for Codex. Run from inside the target repo. |
| `sync-coderabbit-yaml.sh` | Sync the comments-only `.coderabbit.yaml` from `templates/` into a target repo. |
| `clear-cache.sh` | Clear zenhive plugin cache + stale registry entries (also sweeps legacy deltahedge/claude-code-elixir). |
| `migrate-repos-deltahedge-to-zenhive.sh` | Rename `@deltahedge` → `@zenhive` in a repo's `.claude/settings.json` (dry-run by default). |

## Roadmap

This repo uses `rmap` — `roadmap/tasks.toml` is canonical, `ROADMAP.md` +
`roadmap/data.json` are rendered. Propose plugin changes (hook misfires, missing
skills, command bugs) via `rmap new` here; don't edit installed copies in
`~/.claude/plugins/`. After any hand-edit of `tasks.toml`, run `rmap validate`.

## Validation

```bash
claude plugin validate --strict   # manifest validation (CI-grade)
```
